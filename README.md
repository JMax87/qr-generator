# Professor Maxwell Squarecode Synthesizer

Most important requirements are FreeSimpleGUI and qrcode[pil].

Click run and you get the famous popup GUI!

All your QR codes met! Anything else not in the app - you do not really need it!

Also released an exectuable for Linux and Windows with Pyinstaller - sorry no Mac version until I can get on one of the machines to do that! Unless that's what a pull request can do?

Thanks to everyone who encourged me to make "Pytober" great and got me to finish this!
