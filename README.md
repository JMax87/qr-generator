# Professor Maxwell's Squarecode Synthesizer

- Most important requirements are FreeSimpleGUI and qrcode[pil].
- All your QR codes met! Anything else not in the app - you do not really need it!
- Enjoy running your own QR code generator locally and offline, no giving your credentials to a website or paying them!
- qrgen.py is my original code, still works and competely runs in CLI.
- squarecodesynth.py is the finished "app", click run and you get the famous popup GUI!
- Also released an exectuable for Linux and Windows with Pyinstaller - sorry no Mac version until I can get on one of the machines to do that! Unless that's what a pull request can do?

Thanks to everyone who encourged me to make "Pytober" great and got me to finish this!
